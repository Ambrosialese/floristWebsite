    <h1 class="centreText"> Our Potted Plants for sale</h1>
    <p class="centreText">Our selection of greenery intended for those looking to add some colour to their living spaces. <br> We do have mostly real plants that do inevitably require you to take care of them, from giving large enough pots and enough soil to allow them to grow roots and manage to continue growing, keeping them in sunlight and of course watering them, however we do also have a selection of "fake" plastic plants that won't grow, but also won't wilt.<br> We do provide small guides to take care of the plants in the packages that we sell them in, but we do also provide personal advice in person and on our email and social media pages  </p>
